## 💡 Philosophy

These tools embody a core belief: **AI isn't here to replace us—it's here to jam with us.**

Rather than treating AI as a faster search engine or productivity hack, this toolkit approaches AI collaboration as genuine teamwork. Each tool is designed to:

- Make implicit work explicit (like shared project context)
- Enable better human-AI collaboration
- Remove friction from team workflows
- Keep humans at the center
